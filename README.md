1.	Javascript(Fundamentals)

What displays in the Console with the following Code:

i.	 console.log(false==undefined)

	The answer for this is: false
Explaination:
Undefined in Javascript means that a variable has been declared but has not been given or initialized with a value.
Here, false is a value that we can assign for a Boolean variable and hence, it is not undfined.

ii.	console.log(false==null)

	The answer for this is: false
Explaination:
Null in Javascript means that the value is empty or does not exist. As mentioned above, ‘false’ is a value which can be assigned to a Boolean variable and hence, it is not null.

iii.	console.log(null==undefined)

	The answer for this is: true
Explaination:
Null can be treated as an undefined value because it is not initialized or does not have any value.

2.	Algorithms(Javascript)
Separate file is attached.
A Screenshot of the Output along with code is attached below:

  


3.	APIs, HTML, CSS, React

i.	What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface, which establishes a connection between two applications. Whenever we use an application in our smart device, we have to connect to the internet and it sends information to the server. The server then responds back to the application after fetching the data and hence, the application presents it to us in a readable manner.

ii.	Compare and Contrast GET and POST requests.
The major difference is that a GET request is used to fetch data whereas a POST request is used to send data to a source. GET request cannot modify the data and are stored in the browser history but POST requests seem  to be safer then the GET requests because they do not remain in the browser history. Also GET requests should be limited in length whereas POST requests can extend as much as user wants. POST requests can be never cached while GET requests can be cached.

iii.	What is the difference between a span and a div tag? When should we use either?
A div tag is used to write a block of code while a span tag is used to just write small pieces of text. It wraps around inline elements.

iv.	What are the major features of React?
Features of React include the following:
1.	Components
2.	Virtual DOM
3.	Conditional Statements
4.	Performance
5.	Data binding
6.	JSX

v.	What is the difference between element and component?
Element is a basic building block and is not reusable whereas a component is imported from other Javascript file and is reusable. An element is returned by the component. React hooks cannot be used with elements as they are immutable but can be used with functional components. Elements are faster and components are slower and an element does not have any methods but component has methods.
